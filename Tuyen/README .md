Project Title:Meals of Distribution- Sharing Table
Author: Nguyen Anh Tuyen
Description:
This project visualizes the concept of shared resources through an interactive table. Some plates are empty, while others have spirals that activate when the user interacts with them, symbolizing the redistribution of food. When users interact, food is shared with the plates that have spirals, highlighting the dynamic nature of food access and sharing. The project was developed as part of the Zero Hunger theme for Assignment 2 of COMM2754 at RMIT Digital Media.

How to Use:

Click to interact with the plates and items on the table.

Observe how food is shared to plates with spirals when you interact with them.

Rotate the knobs to change between different versions of the simulation and adjust the volume.

The louder the volume, the more urgent the need to act, symbolizing the growing crisis of hunger.
