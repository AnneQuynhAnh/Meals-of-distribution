Project Title: Meals of Distribution- Sushi Belt
Author: Truong Quynh Anh
Description:
This project visualizes the global food distribution challenge using a sushi belt system. Plates continuously move, symbolizing the flow of food—some plates are full, others are empty—highlighting the disparities in food access. The project was developed as part of the Zero Hunger theme for Assignment 2 of COMM2754 at RMIT Digital Media.

How to Use:

Click to interact with the plates.

Observe the food-sharing patterns as the plates move along the belt.

Rotate the knobs to change between different versions of the simulation and adjust the volume.

The louder the volume, the more urgent the need to act, symbolizing the growing crisis of hunger.
